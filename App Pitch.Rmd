## What is it?
This program is designed to calculate the net premium of a life insurance product, 
Simply put in your age, smoking status, and insurance product details and have the net 
premium calculated.


## Assumptions

The method used to calculate the premium is the equivalence principle. This method mathces the
benefits paid to the premium received, with regards to the death risk at each age and the risk-free rate.
