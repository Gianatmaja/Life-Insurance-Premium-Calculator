# Life-Insurance-Premium-Calculator

The web application can be accessed [here](https://gian-atmaja.shinyapps.io/LI_Premium/).

This web application, deployed using R's shiny, estimates the cost of coverage for a life insurance policy in Indonesia.
The calculations used are based on the life table from the [Global Health Observatory Data Repository](https://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.main.60750?lang=en).

The inputs taken by the web application includes:
- Type of policy (Whole-life, Endowment, and Term Insurance)
- Term of protection (For endowment and term policies)
- Age, gender, and smoking status
- Sum assured

The web application then outputs an amount, representing the annual cost of coverage required under the inputs and set assumptions.

For more details on the assumptions, calculations, or on the types of policies, kindly view the slide deck created for the web application [here](https://rpubs.com/Ga25/620229).
