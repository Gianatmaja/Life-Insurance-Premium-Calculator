# Life-Insurance-Premium-Calculator

This web application, deployed using R's shiny, estimates the cost of coverage for a life insurance policy in Indonesia.
The calculations used are based on the life table from the [Global Health Observatory Data Repository](https://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.main.60750?lang=en).

The inputs taken by the web application includes:
- Type of policy (Whole-life, Endowment, and Term Insurance)
- Term of protection (For endowment and term policies)
- Age, gender, and smoking status
- Sum assured

The web application then outputs an amount, representing the annual cost of coverage required under the inputs and set assumptions.

The web application can be accessed [here](https://gian-atmaja.shinyapps.io/LI_Premium/).
